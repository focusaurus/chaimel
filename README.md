[chai.js](http://chaijs.com/) expect BDD api wrapped with `camelCase` method names instead of `dot.chaining.style`.

Lets you do:

- `expect(error).toHaveProperty("message");` instead of
- `expect(error).to.have.property("message");`

## Usage
```
var expect = require("chaimel");
expect(42).notToBeAbove(43);
```

## Why?

`dot.chaining.style` is problematic for me because:

- It's out of convention with the standard JavaScript built-in method names
  - `toLowerCase`, `indexOf`, `forEach`,  `hasOwnProperty`
- It's awkward to speak and hear. Do you say the "dot"s or just imply them?
- It doesn't work well with text editor autocomplete, whereas `camelCase` does
- I also personally find this kind of use of `Object.defineProperty` unidiomatic for the golden age of JavaScript. It's fully standard and fine, but my opinion is it fundamentally makes the language more magical and ruby-like and these are drawbacks not advantages.
- It was pretty quick and easy to create this module, so I did

## Are all the chai.expect methods supported?

**No**, I left out abbreviations such as `eql`, `lt` `gt` because I hate abbreviations. Use the full words and use `deepEqual` instead of `eql`. Having both `equal` and `eql` with different semantics is error-prone, hard to remember, and confusing to read.

## Browser Support

The code is designed to work in node.js or in the browser via [browserify](http://browserify.org). If you want vanilla browser support, file and issue and I can add the neccessary boilerplate.
